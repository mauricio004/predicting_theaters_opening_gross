**Description:**

The goal of this project is to develop a model to help movie theaters estimate the   
opening gross profit for high budget movies.      
Movie theaters split gross profits with studios/distributors following an sliding scale.     
On average, movie theaters keep 50% of gross profits and collect the other 50%.    
However, for high budget movies, movie theaters can collect only 20% of gross profits    
during the first weeks after release.  Movie theaters need to decide which movies to play.  
If they decide to play major blockbusters, they keep a small percentage of profits  
during the first weeks.  On the other end, if they decide to play regular movies, they  
keep on average 50% since the beginning.  Major blockbusters might attract more viewers  
contributing to higher gross profits.
